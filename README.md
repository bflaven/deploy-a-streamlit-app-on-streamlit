# deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit
yet another streamlit deployment on streamlit!

**rename branch from main to master to have a clean url**



## Infos

- If your app has name streamlit_app.py and your branch is master, your app is also given a shortened URL of the form *https://share.streamlit.io/[user_name]/[repo_name]*. The only time you need the full URL is when you deployed multiple apps from the same repo. So you can also reach the example URL above at the short URL https://share.streamlit.io/bflaven/deploy-a-streamlit-app-on-streamlit.

- The default branch is considered the “base” branch in your repository, against which all pull requests and code commits are automatically made, unless you specify a different branch.
